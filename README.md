# ML-Classification-Models
This project is about past loans. The Loan_train.csv data set includes details of 346 customers whose loan are already paid off or defaulted. The objective is to help the company to predict which customer will default on his/her loan. Different Machine learning algorithms will be explored to find the best model.
